# Validation before implementation

## Platform spikes (release blocking)

Spikes S1 (#1), S2 (#2), S3 (#3) and S4 (#4) closed on 2026-10-24. Each row says what a spike confirmed, with measured numbers, and what is still a platform assumption that needs validation. Detail is in each issue's comments and in `SPIKE_NOTES.md` on the `spike/s1-safari`, `spike/s2-chrome` and `spike/s4-herdr` branches.

Decision 0003 (2026-10-20), Chrome first: without a paid Apple developer account, Safari disables the unsigned FocusPilot extension whenever Safari quits. FocusPilot therefore enforces through Chrome first (#16, built in #44), and its own Safari extension (#13) is deferred. Safari is covered for now by an owner-chosen third-party blocker, which protection status shows as "external blocker, not verified". The owner confirmed real blocking with #44: example.com is always blocked, and youtube.com only during sessions.

| Spike | Evidence and status | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Safari messaging | Confirmed by S1 (2026-10-15; ad-hoc signed, unsandboxed app with a sandboxed extension). With the app closed, the extension enforced a normal session's end about 0.26 s late, kept a strict session blocking past its end, applied exceptions in about 0.2 s and re-blocked 0.2–0.3 s after expiry. An app→Safari push was lost when Safari had unloaded the extension (2 of 24), while still reporting success; a 1-minute sync covers it. Deferred with #13 (decision 0003, 2026-10-20). Still needs validation: sleep/wake (S1 T6, deferred to #13), and Developer ID signing and distribution. | Third-party Safari blocker shown as not verified; app-open requirement with honest state |
| Chrome transport | Confirmed by S2 (2026-10-17, Chrome 155): a native host registered only at user level. Chrome refuses an origin missing from `allowed_origins` ("Access to the specified native messaging host is forbidden.") without launching the host. An open `connectNative` port kept the worker alive through 12.6 min with no traffic. Reconnect after the host exits takes 1.2 s. A repointed manifest is picked up without restarting Chrome. A missing host binary and a missing manifest give the same error. Overwriting the running host did not stop it (replace atomically anyway). Built in #44: the host ships in the app bundle; the manifest is rewritten at each launch, which repairs a moved app; observations stay queued until the host acknowledges each sequence number, which fixes an observation lost in S2. Still needs validation: a second extension trying to reach the host (only the `allowed_origins` mechanism was shown), and several Chrome profiles at once. | Separate signed helper, subject to distribution review |
| Browser rules | Confirmed by S3 in both browsers. **Chrome** (2026-10-17): open blocked tabs at session start reached the blocked page in 64–94 ms. A playing video was paused 3 ms after its exception expired, and the blocked page showed at +67 ms. YouTube and Instagram in-app (SPA) navigation was caught within 1 ms through the Navigation API, with the blocked page at +47–68 ms. The design: the content script acts first (pauses media, replaces the page) and the worker redirects any tab still there after 1.5 s. A content script left orphaned by an extension update only gets the backup (1.57 s), so #44 re-injects on install. **Safari** (2026-10-19): the background `tabs.update` is the guarantee, because hidden tabs get no page timers (+278–397 ms). DNR `redirect` to an extension page fails open, so use `block`. Tab ids are not stable, so query each time. Still needs validation: Chrome incognito blocking on a real navigation (the access state is reported; decision 0003, 2026-10-22), Safari private windows, embeds on other sites, withdrawn site access, picture-in-picture and casting, and real (trusted) clicks for SPA navigation, since synthetic clicks were used. | Document unsupported cases; do not claim protection there |
| Exception expiry | Measured while awake. Chrome: DNR rule changes 0–2 ms late; with the host absent and the worker stopped, an alarm-started worker removed the rule 195 ms late. Safari: 0.2–0.3 s, but Safari alarms fire no sooner than about 30 s after they are created, so a transition less than 30 s away can be up to 30 s late. Still needs validation: sleep/wake in both browsers (Safari deferred with #13; Chrome content-script timers may not count time asleep, with the worker alarm and reconcile-on-wake as the backstop), browser quit and relaunch, and timers in long-hidden Chrome tabs. | Conservative blocking until reconciled |
| Cross-process state | Confirmed by S1: on macOS 15+, a `group.` App Group on an ad-hoc-signed app prompts "access data from other apps" on every container access. A folder in `~/Library/Application Support` shared through the extension's home-relative temporary exception gave 0 prompts in 32 min. Expected but untested, since there is no developer membership: a `<TeamID>.` group under Developer ID does not prompt. Chrome (S2, #44): the host reads a 0600 policy file and records acknowledged observations for the app to import. Still needs validation: the App Sandbox for the app itself. | App-open requirement with honest state |
| Herdr access | Confirmed by S4 (2026-10-16, Herdr 0.9.0/protocol 22, unsandboxed ad-hoc app launched with an empty environment): resolve the binary from fixed paths, select a session via `session list --json`/`--session`, list/read agents, and focus an explicit agent or tab with `agent focus`/`tab focus`. Still needs validation: several attached TUI clients, a real Login Item (`SMAppService`) launch, and App Sandbox/hardened-runtime/notarized distribution (a sandboxed app likely cannot run `~/.local/bin/herdr` or reach `~/.config/herdr/*.sock`; this is a distribution risk) | Read-only/manual linking until solved; unsandboxed Developer ID build if the sandbox blocks access |
| Folder access | User-selected roots, bookmark persistence, moved folders, collisions/symlinks | Explicit user re-selection and repair |
| Lifecycle | Close window vs quit, restart session restoration, stale observations | No live-state assumptions on recovery |
| iPhone signal | Mac turns a synced Focus on/off via the shortcuts tool; iPhone open/close automations run without confirmation, check the Focus, show the current action, optionally return to the Home Screen and append to an iCloud Drive file; sync delay measured | Phone nudge unavailable; Opal alone covers the phone |
| Unsupported browsers | Detect other browsers or unprotected profiles frontmost during a session | Degraded state shown; no coverage claim |
| External usage | Documented source formats (first candidate: Claude Code OpenTelemetry metrics via an authenticated local receiver), run attribution, cumulative counter resets and overlap with exports | Unavailable/unattributed; no invented total-computer spend |
| Agent interruption | Fresh identity/state, supported interrupt mechanism (none in inspected Herdr commands), checkpoint/resumption and child process behavior | Manual navigation; no pause or generic termination claims |

Usage accounting and the LangSmith exporter are deterministic logic with no platform unknowns except provider counter semantics and the chosen transport (REST or OTLP); cover them with the correctness scenarios below rather than spikes.

Spike order, as run: Safari slice (S1, sleep/wake deferred), Chrome slice with content-script expiry (S2, S3), Herdr from a GUI app (S4). Still open: observe-only metrics so the baseline week can start, folder bookmarks and provisioning (S5, #5), the iPhone signal (S6, #6), external usage and interruption.

Validate the proposed Developer ID direct distribution route, including Safari signing, and choose minimum macOS, Safari and Chrome versions. Native-host relocation and update were tested in S2, and #44 repairs a stale host path at every launch. Still to test: permissions revoked, and baseline energy use while idle. Do not build the full supervisor around unproven transports.

## Product experiments

Baseline week followed by a two-week pilot alternating comparable Quiet and Coach sessions. The baseline requires an observe-only mode (activity and Event metrics, no blocking or nudges), so it must exist before blocking is enabled. Start with blocking + chosen next action, then introduce coach check-ins to isolate their value.

Proposed measures: task capture under 30 seconds for simple tasks; resume context within 15 seconds when integrations are healthy; median task upkeep under 5 minutes/day; fewer unplanned distraction visits; useful versus unwanted check-ins; completed deliverables. Thresholds require pilot calibration.

If coach messages are mostly dismissed, reduce triggers and improve next-action support. If task maintenance exceeds benefits, simplify capture and context attachment before adding integrations.

## Correctness scenarios

- Relative deadline with Bogotá timezone; date-only deadline; DST elsewhere; past deadline.
- Priority changes while recommendation is pending; stale result rejected.
- Agent finishes but task needs human review; unknown never means done.
- Pane closed/reused, agent renamed, different server with same ID.
- Extension disabled, permissions revoked, unacknowledged policy.
- Browser switching retains shared exception deadline.
- A blocked site is already open as an SPA; browser reconnect after exception expiry.
- Model unavailable: timers/blocking/tasks continue; no repeated retries storm.
- Prompt injection in assignment/page/agent output cannot execute tool actions.
- Memory deletion removes derived retrieval entries.
- Provisioning interruption produces recoverable partial state without overwriting anything.
- App crashes mid-session: in a normal session extensions keep blocking until the planned end, then stop without the app; in a strict session they keep blocking until the app reconnects; exceptions expire on time in both.
- Unknown app or site during Coach: one check-in after the grace period; the saved answer suppresses repeat questions for that app in that scope; seeded tools never trigger a question; no question while the owner is typing.
- Date-only deadline never acquires an implicit time; timed deadline keeps its timezone.
- Second supervisor request waits while one is in flight (P0); once concurrency is allowed, two concurrent model requests reserve the same budget period without double allocation.
- Interrupted stream with missing usage remains unresolved rather than free; reservations survive restart.
- Cached/reasoning token subsets do not double-count totals; retries have unique attempt records.
- External cumulative usage resets; duplicate local/LangSmith request telemetry; stale and unknown sources.
- Subscription allowance is displayed separately from an API-equivalent estimate and actual bills.
- LangSmith outage/retries do not block UI or local admission; disabling export clears pending uploads.
- Metadata-only payloads exclude task text, URLs, paths, secrets and private free-form errors; remote deletion failure is visible.
- Urgent-task recommendation protects dependencies and identifies which bottleneck stopping work would address.
- Interruption fails or times out after delivery; read actual state before retrying; shell/remote jobs may still run.

## Design review

Sketch native planning, focus, blocked page, setup preview, and disconnected states. Validate keyboard/accessibility behavior. Only implement a vertical slice after the platform and authority boundaries are concrete.
