# FocusPilot

Working name for a native macOS focus assistant. Design phase; no app has been implemented.

FocusPilot helps its owner choose a concrete next action, work across Herdr and browser tools, and return from distraction. It supports existing project folders and creates new task environments only under user-configured parent folders.

## Current constraints

Mac-only. SwiftUI and AppKit for the app. Safari is primary; Chrome also needs focus rules. Herdr is a source of task execution state. Tasks and deadlines are managed in the app initially. Data is local by default; a remote model would receive explicitly selected context. Files remain within the owner's folder structure.

## Next step

Resolve the release-blocking platform spikes in the validation plan, then prototype the planning window, focus panel, and distraction page. Review the flows before implementing a broad supervisor.

## Status

This repository contains specifications, not validated claims of platform compatibility or bypass-resistant blocking. Proposed thresholds are starting hypotheses for testing.
